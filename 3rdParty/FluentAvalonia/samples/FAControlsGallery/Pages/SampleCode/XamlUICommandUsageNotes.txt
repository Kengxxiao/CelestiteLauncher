XamlUICommand allows the sharing of the UX associated with a command. In this instance we create a simple Custom Command with a label, icon, shortcut, and description. It's defined as a resource and could be used in many controls, like this CommandBarButton. The button (and other controls) automatically get all these UI properties without the need to define the properties again.

Currently supported controls:
CommandBarButton
CommandBarToggleButton
MenuFlyoutItem

NOTE: Using hotkeys can with XamlUICommand can crash. See the StandardUICommand page for more on this, and workaround to prevent the crash.
