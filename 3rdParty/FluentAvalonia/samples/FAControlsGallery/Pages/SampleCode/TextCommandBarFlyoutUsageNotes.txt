You don't specify commands for a TextCommandBarFlyout, they're automatically preset based on the controls they're attached to. It is a bit more limited than WinUI because of the lack of rich text support in Avalonia when this was implemented.
TextCommandBarFlyout is the default ContextFlyout for TextBox in FluentAvalonia. It will adapt based on clipboard state, text selection, password box, etc. No Bold/Italic/Underline options are available yet, however.

TextBlocks (and SelectableTextBlock) also can be provided one to offer a 'Copy' command to copy the TextBlock's text to the clipboard. Just declare a TextCommandBarFlyout as a resource, and reference it as the TextBlock's ContextFlyout.
