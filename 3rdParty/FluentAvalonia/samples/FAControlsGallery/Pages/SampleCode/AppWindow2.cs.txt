// To start, implement IApplicationSplashScreen
// There you can customize the display.
// You have three options for how the splash screen displays (prioritized in this order):
// 1 - User set custom content (SplashScreenContent) - can be anything you want
// 2 - Application Icon centered image (AppIcon)
// 3 - Application Name centered text (AppName)

// The SplashScreen is set to only open the first time the window opens, so you you need to 
// Show/Hide the main window, it won't show each time

// This is the splash screen used by this sample app

TODO:

public class MainWindow : AppWindow
{
    public MainWindow()
    {
        InitializeComponent();

        // Set your splash screen and the rest is taken care of when you open the window
        SplashScreen = new SampleAppSplashScreen();
    }

    // NOTE: If you override OnOpened for custom logic, be sure to call base.OnOpened() FIRST
    // as that allows the SplashScreen to run which will hold the loading of window content
    // until it finishes (unless you must run something first).
